# Terminal and Git Commands

## Terminal commands I learned in lectures
- `ls` - Listar filer och mappar i den aktuella katalogen.
- `cd` - Byter katalog. Exempel: `cd /Documents`.
- `mkdir` - Skapar en ny mapp. Exempel: `mkdir ny_mapp`.

## Terminal commands I have looked up on my own
- `find` - Searches for files and directories based on specified criteria. Example: `find /home -name "*.txt"` finds all `.txt` files in the `/home`directory. 

## Git commands I learned in lectures
- `git init` - Initializes a new Git repository.
- `git status` -  Displays the status of changes in the repository, including modified files and the current branch.

## Git commands I have looked up on my own
- `git rebase` - Rebases a branch into another. Itâ€™s used to integrate changes and keep the commit history linear. 
- `git stash` - Temporarily saves changes in a stash without committing them, allowing you to restore them later. 

## Markdown and GitHub
- Markdown is a simple way to format text in files on GitHub. Here is an example of a [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
- On GitHub, you can manage issues, create pull requests, and collaborate with others in teams through `GitHub Projects`.
